# Trello Clone

This is a front-end Trello clone built in React that makes requests against a fake REST API. First, clone the project and install dependencies with `yarn install`. Then run `yarn mock-api` to start a fake REST API at `localhost:3000`. Now run `yarn start` to start your front-end application at `localhost:8000`

## Commands

### `yarn install` ###

### `yarn mock-api`

http://localhost:3000/columnOrder

http://localhost:3000/cards

http://localhost:3000/columns

### `yarn start`
